# Installation:

You can compile the source code normally (see "Compiling") and put the binary in your SRB2 directory. No additional assets required, it works right out the box!

# Changes

## HUD
- CEchos/CSays print message into console ("`showcsays`")
- Joining netgame shows progress bar on "checking files" ([Lugent's PR](https://git.do.srb2.org/STJr/SRB2/-/merge_requests/2446) [Lugent's PR](https://git.do.srb2.org/STJr/SRB2/-/merge_requests/2556))
- Easily rejoin servers you've played before! (Multiplayer -> Rejoin Previous Servers...)
- Draw gif information to hud ("`moviemodeinfo`")
- Crosshairs can invert pixels behind, to improve their visibility ("`crosshair_invert`")
- Thin captions and thin FPS! (Load "tinyfontfix.pk3" for music note on thin captions)
- Countdown beep isn't ear piercingly loud!
- Snake download game background fixed!
- Master Server list background for better readability!
- Server Menu before joining! ("`showserverinfo`") (Code from [SRB2Classic](https://codeberg.org/srb2classic/srb2classic))

## Visual
- Toggable mobj pitch/roll functional (3d rotation for models on slopes, like DRRR). Option located in Video Settings -> Level -> "Pitch/Roll Rotation"
- Ring-Racers-styled screen quakes! ("`rr_quakes`" in console)
- Toggleable Screenshake effects! ("`earthquake`", ported from SRB2Classic by @archiNiko)

- View rollangle is interpolated!
- Experimental translation support for models! ("`gl_modeltranslations`")
- Render distance for OpenGL! ("`gr_renderdistance`", @GLideKS)

## Gameplay / Netplay
- Skin change at any time
- Addfilelocal from SRB2K Saturn! (use "`addfilelocal`" command or press R-ALT in the addons menu)
- Minimum input delay from SRB2Kart Saturn/Ring Racers! (`mindelay`)
- Improved startup times! (Code from [SRB2Classic](https://codeberg.org/srb2classic/srb2classic))

## Modding and Debugging
- `renderhitbox` in multiplayer
- Lua HUD interpolation from SRB2K Saturn
- "`freezelevel`" debug command (Be careful using when clients are connected!)
- HUD camera struct updates position in first person! (credits [Jiskster](https://git.do.srb2.org/STJr/SRB2/-/merge_requests/2629) & [Hanicef](https://git.do.srb2.org/Hanicef/SRB2Classic/-/commit/681bd160f5be3925a97d798d00e67b32a8c1df71))
- `v.cachePatch` accepts a second parameter for rotation! (https://git.do.srb2.org/STJr/SRB2/-/merge_requests/2662)
- Added "`TR`" as an alias to "`TICRATE`" in Lua

## GIFs
- Adjustable gif size cap, toggable too! (`gif_maxsize`, "Max GIF Size (MB)")
    - ^ When gif is capped, gif_rolling allows for another gif to immediately start! (`gif_rolling`, "Keep recording when capped")
- Pause GIFs *WHILE* Recording! (Bound to F2 by default)

# Lua Additions

## Global variables
- "`takis_custombuild`" (Read only) (boolean) :  Global to detect if the client is using this build
- "`takis_complexlocaladdons`" (Read only) (boolean) : Global to detect if the client has loaded local addons with lua in them
- "`takis_locallyloading`" (Read only) (boolean) : Only set during script loading, detects whether the script is being loaded locally

  Example:
  ```lua
  if (takis_locallyloading) then
    --do local stuff here
    return
  end
  --normal, gameplay editing code
  ```
- "`demoplayback`" (Read only) (boolean) : True if viewing a demo.
- "`takis_wadnum`" (Read only) (int) : Only set during script loading/AddonLoaded hook, returns the number of the addon currently being loaded. (numwadfiles - 1)

## Functions
- `P_GetLocalAiming(player_t player)` : Returns the angle_t `aiming` of `player` if they are a local player. Returns 0 otherwise.
- `P_GetLocalAngle(player_t player)` : Returns the angle_t `angle` of `player` if they are a local player. Returns 0 otherwise.

- `io.openlump(string filename, [string mode, [UINT32 wadnum]])` : Similar to `io.openlocal`, but reads a lump inside any WAD/PK3 file loaded. The `wadnum` argument can be obtained from `takis_wadnum`, otherwise it will scan addons from end to start.

  Example:
  ```lua
  local file = io.openlump("lua/main.lua","r",6)
  
  if file
  	local dat = file:read("*a")
  	print("length: "..dat:len())
  	file:close()
  else
  	print("could not read lump")
  end
  ```

- `v.interpolate/v.interpLatch(boolean/int)` : See [SRB2K Saturn's documentation](https://github.com/Indev450/SRB2Kart-Saturn/blob/Saturn/LUASTUFF.md)
- `v.drawFixedFill` : Same as `v.drawFill`, but x, y, width, and height arguments are all in fixed point scale.
### For "uncappedgame" HUD hooks:
- `v.timeFraction()` : Returns the value of `rendertimefrac` [0, FRACUNIT]. "The fraction of a tic being drawn (for interpolation between two tics)"
- `v.deltaTics()` : Returns the value of `renderdeltatics`. "Evaluated delta tics for this frame (how many tics since the last frame)"
- `v.isNewTic()` : Returns whether the current render is the start of a new gamelogic tic or not. (boolean)
- `v.usingInterpolation()` : Returns whether or not frame interpolation is enabled. (boolean)

Example script that uses manual interpolation:
```lua
local scroll = 0
addHook("HUD",function(v,p,cam)
	local width = (v.width() / v.dupx())*FU
	if v.isNewTic()
		scroll = ($ + 4*FU) % width
	end
	local x = (scroll + (4*v.timeFraction())) % width
	v.drawScaled(x, 100*FU, FU, v.cachePatch("MISSING"),V_SNAPTOLEFT)

	v.drawScaled(scroll, 140*FU, FU, v.cachePatch("MISSING"),V_SNAPTOLEFT)
end,"uncappedgame")
```

- `M_Random`* : Same as `v.Random*` functions, except also client-sided and not limited to HUD hooks.

## Hooks
- `"uncappedgame"` : A new hud hook that runs during gameplay, except not bound to the 35 fps limit. Introduces new functions into the draw for manual interpolation. (WIP)

## mobj_t
- `mobj.pitch/roll` : Now rotates mobjs in 3D space, including models

Example that tilts your character in their 3D direction:
```lua
addHook("PlayerThink",function(p)
    local me = p.mo
    if not (me and me.valid) then return end

    local angle = R_PointToAngle2(0,0, me.momx,me.momy)
    local mang = R_PointToAngle2(0,0, FixedHypot(me.momx, me.momy), me.momz)
    mang = InvAngle($)

    me.roll = FixedMul(mang, sin(angle))
    me.pitch = FixedMul(mang, cos(angle))
end)
```

## player_t
- `player.ipaddress` (string) (read only): For use in moderation addons, this only returns a string for the server of the players IP address. Clients _cannot_ see other clients' IP addresses. The only way for other clients to know is if the server sends a command with them or something :p
- `player.muted` (boolean) (read + write): Returns whether or not the player is muted. (though changes may not be reflected in servers not running edit)


## renderflags_t
- `RF_ALWAYSONTOP` : The sprite always draws on top of level geometry and other sprites. Not supported for models, and culled sprites wont be rendered. Note that in OpenGL, anything transparent will render on any `RF_ALWAYSONTOP` sprites
- `RF_HIDEINSKYBOX` : The sprite will be hidden in the skybox.
- `RF_NOMODEL` : The sprite will be forced to not use a model in OpenGL.


## eflags_t
- `MFE_NOPITCHROLLEASING` : When "pitchroll-easing" is toggled, adding this eflag will not ease the pitch/roll axis this tic. Removed at the end of MobjThinker.
